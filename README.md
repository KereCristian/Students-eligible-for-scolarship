This C++ problem involves identifying the student who will receive the performance scholarship and determining the number of students who will receive the merit scholarship in the next academic year.
For the performance scholarship, we need to find the student with the highest overall average from the entire list. 
Regarding the merit scholarships, we need to identify full-time students with a general average above 8.00 and award scholarships in descending order of averages, respecting the maximum number of available scholarships.
